* Tap a square to place or remove a marker
* Refresh to get a new card

## Contributing

### Code

* Bingo functionality is in [card.jsx](src/card.jsx)
* Styles are in [styles.css](src/styles.css)
* The list of items is in [items.json](src/items.json)

#### How do I suggest something?

* With a GitHub account, you can hit "edit" on the [item list](src/items.json)
  * "Commit changes" when you're done and follow the prompts to make a fork and pull request
  * Don't worry about messing anything up, I'll review these
* Or you can comment on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstOfOctober/comments/1nuwwhd/foo_bingo_card_generator_is_back_online/)

#### What makes a good suggestion?

* It _could_ appear in any future year (they will drink coffee again, but they (probably?) won't record at Abbey Road again)
* It won't _necessarily_ appear in any given year (they will (probably?) always write ten songs, they won't always have family visit in the studio)
* It fits on the card (aim for about as long as the existing items)

## What the heck is all this about?!
